SQLAlchemy Homework Surfs Up!

This repository is composed by two main files:

1. Climate_starter.ipynb

2. app.py

The first one corresponds to the Climate Analysis and exploration step. It doesn't include (yet) the bonus part, but the suggested functions are not erased. The second one is the flask application.
